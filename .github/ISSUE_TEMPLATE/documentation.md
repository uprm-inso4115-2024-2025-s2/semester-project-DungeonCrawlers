# Objective
Provide an objective for the task (What would the task accomplish if implemented?)

### Guidelines and Feedback
Paste *everything* that the professor has said about this topic here. This includes evaluation criteria, guidelines, and feedback. If this is a lecture topic task, either specify the date that the professor talked about it or the presentation and slides about the topic.

### Checklist
Take the above section and create a markdown checklist with every point that must be accounted for based on what the professor has said. You may use a large language model to generate this checklist. Then, while you write the documentation, check each point that your documentation complies with by editing this description. Before you mark this issue as completed, make sure you considered every point from guidelines, feedback, or lectures.
